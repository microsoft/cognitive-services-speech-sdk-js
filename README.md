# Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech SDK for JavaScript

The Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech SDK for JavaScript is the JavaScript version of the Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech SDK. An in-depth description of feature set, functionality, supported platforms, as well as installation options is available [here](https://aka.ms/csspeech).

The JavaScript versions of the Cognitive Services Speech SDK supports browser scenarios as well as the Node.js environment.

## Installing

For the latest stable version:

```bash
npm install microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk
```

## Documentation

* [Quick tutorial - Node.js](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/quickstart-js-node)
* [API Reference](https://aka.ms/csspeech/javascriptref)
* [Speech SDK Homepage](https://aka.ms/csspeech)

## Samples

* Quick-start samples for Node.js: In the [Speech SDK samples repo](https://aka.ms/csspeech/samples) under quickstart/javascript/node.
* Quick-start samples for Browser: In the [Speech SDK samples repo](https://aka.ms/csspeech/samples) under quickstart/javascript/browser.
* Other Node.js and Browser samples: In the [Speech SDK samples repo](https://aka.ms/csspeech/samples) under samples/js.

## Building

This source code for the Cognitive Services Speech SDK (JavaScript) is available in a public [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/cognitive-services-speech-sdk-js). You are not required to go through the build process. We create prebuilt packages tuned for your use-cases. These are updated in regular intervals.

In order to build the Speech SDK, ensure that you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Version requirement for Node: 12.44.0 or higher (or 14.17.0 or higher for Node 14).

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/cognitive-services-speech-sdk-js
```

Change to the Speech SDK directory:

```bash
cd cognitive-services-speech-sdk-js
```

Run setup to pull updated dependency versions:

```
npm run setup
```

Install the required packages:

```
npm install
```

Run the build:

```
npm run build
```

## Testing

### Run all tests

Run tests (see [ci/build.yml](ci/build.yml)) -- complete results require several specifically-configured subscriptions, but incomplete results can be obtained with a subset (expect and ignore failures involving missing assignments).

At a minimum, invoking `npm run test` will compile/lint the test files to catch early problems in test code changes.

    RunTests.cmd ^
        SpeechSubscriptionKey:SPEECH_KEY ^
        SpeechRegion:SPEECH_REGION ^
        LuisSubscriptionKey:LUIS_KEY ^
        LuisRegion:LUIS_REGION ^
        SpeechTestEndpointId:CUSTOM_ENDPOINT ^
        BotSubscription:BOT_KEY ^
        BotRegion:BOT_REGION ^
        SpeakerIDSubscriptionKey:SPEAKER_ID_KEY ^
        SpeakerIDRegion:SPEAKER_ID_SUBSCRIPTION_REGION ^
        CustomVoiceSubscriptionKey:CUSTOM_VOICE_KEY ^
        CustomVoiceRegion:CUSTOM_VOICE_REGION

### Run a subset of tests

* Edit the file `jest.config.js`. Replace the regex expressions in `testRegex: "tests/.*Tests\\.ts$"` with one that defines the test file (or files)
you want to run. For example, to only run tests defined in `AutoSourceLangDetectionTests.ts`, replace it with `testRegex: "tests/AutoSourceLangDetectionTests.ts"`. Do this is for the two project `jsdom` and `node`.

* Option 1: Use a secrets file. Create the file `secrets\TestConfiguration.ts`. It should import the default configuration settings and define the values of the mandatory ones for this test, as well as and any additional optional settings. For example, to run the `AutoSourceLangDetectionTests.ts` tests, the required mandatory values are the speech key and region (using a fake key here as an example):
    ```javascript
    import { Settings } from "../tests/Settings";
    Settings.SpeechSubscriptionKey = "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef";
    Settings.SpeechRegion = "westcentralus";
    ```
    Then to run the tests type `RunTests.cmd` in the root of the repo.

* Option 2: Use command line arguments. Instead of creating `secrets\TestConfiguration.ts`, pass the values directly to `RunTests.cmd`. For the above example, this would be:
    ```
    RunTests.cmd SpeechSubscriptionKey:0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef SpeechRegion:westcentralus
    ```
* Option 3: Edit the file `tests\Settings.ts` directly and enter values needed to run the test.

* See summary of the test results in `test-javascript-junit.xml`.

## Data / Telemetry

This project collects data and sends it to Microsoft to help monitor our service performance and improve our products and services. Read the [Microsoft
Privacy Statement](https://aka.ms/csspeech/privacy) to learn more.

To disable telemetry, you can call the following API:

```javascript
// disable telemetry data
sdk.Recognizer.enableTelemetry(false);
```

This is a global setting and will disable telemetry for all recognizers (already created or new recognizers).

We strongly recommend you keep telemetry enabled. With telemetry enabled you transmit information about your platform (operating system and possibly, Speech Service relevant information like microphone characteristics, etc.), and information about the performance of the Speech Service (the time when you did send data and when you received data). It can be used to tune the service, monitor service performance and stability, and might help us to analyze reported problems. Without telemetry enabled, it is not possible for us to do any form of detailed analysis in case of a support request.
